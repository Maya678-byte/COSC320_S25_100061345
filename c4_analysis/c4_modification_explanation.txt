Modification: Added Bitwise NOT operator (NOT)




Description:


In summary I Implemented a new instruction, `NOT`, which performs a bitwise NOT operation on the top value of the stack. The `NOT` operator inverts all the bits of the value at the top of the stack (using the `~` operator in C).


How do they affect the compiler’s behaviour?


This modification extends the compiler's capabilities by adding bitwise negation, allowing for more complex bitwise operations in programs.
Example usage: A value `5` on the stack will be transformed into `-6` after applying `NOT`.
